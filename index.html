    <h1>About Me (▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)</h1>
    <h2> I finished 5 years of havo at the Jac. P. Thijsse school in Castricum. I live in Heemskerk. 
        I am interested in computers and gamdsing in general, so I thought the information technology
        study would fit me. I chose to do it in english because most IT terms are english so it makes 
        more sense for me.
    </h2>
    <h3>
        In my free time I like going to the gym, playing games with friends and 
        hanging out. I mostly play online games rather than offline story mode, mostly League of
        Legends. The u.gg button sends you to a link with the current stats of my LoL account. 
        I like playing sports but I'm not playing at a club, but I used to play football
        at a club when I was younger.
